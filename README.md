# Docker Stellar Core Builder

To customize the build, better to check out the Stellar Core repo, as a submodule. Any build customization will be added to this repo.

## Triggering a build

Right now, builds must be triggered manually -- when changes are pushed to the Stellar Core docker repo (whether our fork or when we finally point directly to Satoshipay's).
